Lay a nori sheet on the mat, shiny-side down. Dip your hands in the vinegared water, then pat handfuls of rice on top in a 1cm thick layer, leaving the furthest edge from you clear.\r\n\r\nSTEP 2\r\nSpread over some Japanese mayonnaise. Use a spoon to spread out a thin layer of mayonnaise down the middle of the rice.\r\n\r\nSTEP 3\r\nAdd the filling. Get your child to top the mayonnaise with a line of their favourite fillings – here we’ve used tuna and cucumber.\r\n\r\nSTEP 4\r\nRoll it up. Lift the edge of the mat over the rice, applying a little pressure to keep everything in a tight roll.\r\n\r\nSTEP 5\r\nStick down the sides like a stamp. When you get to the edge without any rice, brush with a little water and continue to roll into a tight roll.\r\n\r\nSTEP 6\r\nWrap in cling film. Remove the mat and roll tightly in cling film before a grown-up cuts the sushi into thick slices, then unravel the cling film.\r\n\r\nSTEP 7\r\nTO MAKE PRESSED SUSHI: Layer over some smoked salmon. Line a loaf tin with cling film, then place a thin layer of smoked salmon inside on top of the cling film.\r\n\r\nSTEP 8\r\nCover with rice and press down. Press about 3cm of rice over the fish, fold the cling film over and press down as much as you can, using another tin if you have one.\r\n\r\nSTEP 9\r\nTip it out like a sandcastle. Turn block of sushi onto a chopping board. Get a grown-up to cut into fingers, then remove the cling film.\r\n\r\nSTEP 10\r\nTO MAKE SUSHI BALLS: Choose your topping. Get a small square of cling film and place a topping, like half a prawn or a small piece of smoked salmon, on it. Use damp hands to roll walnut-sized balls of rice and place on the topping.\r\n\r\nSTEP 11\r\nMake into tight balls. Bring the corners of the cling film together and tighten into balls by twisting it up, then unwrap and serve.","strMealThumb":"https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/g046bb1663960946.jpg","strTags":null,"strYoutube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ub68OxEypaY","strIngredient1":"Sushi Rice","strIngredient2":"Rice wine","strIngredient3":"Caster Sugar","strIngredient4":"Mayonnaise","strIngredient5":"Rice wine","strIngredient6":"Soy Sauce","strIngredient7":"Cucumber","strIngredient8":"","strIngredient9":"","strIngredient10":"","strIngredient11":"","strIngredient12":"","strIngredient13":"","strIngredient14":"","strIngredient15":"","strIngredient16":"","strIngredient17":"","strIngredient18":"","strIngredient19":"","strIngredient20":"","strMeasure1":"300ml ","strMeasure2":"100ml","strMeasure3":"2 tbs","strMeasure4":"3 tbs","strMeasure5":"1 tbs","strMeasure6":"1 tbs","strMeasure7":"1","strMeasure8":" ","strMeasure9":" ","strMeasure10":" ","strMeasure11":" ","strMeasure12":" ","strMeasure13":" ","strMeasure14":" ","strMeasure15":" ","strMeasure16":" ","strMeasure17":" ","strMeasure18":" ","strMeasure19":" ","strMeasure20":" ","strSource":"https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/simple-sushi","strImageSource":null,"strCreativeCommonsConfirmed":null,"dateModified":null},{"idMeal":"53060","strMeal":"Burek","strDrinkAlternate":null,"strCategory":"Side","strArea":"Croatian","strInstructions":"Fry the finely chopped onions and minced meat in oil.

Fair warning, this will probably turn your lentils into a solid block that you’ll have to break up later\r\nIn a large pot over medium-high heat, sauté the olive oil and the onion with a pinch of salt for about 3 minutes, then add the carrots and cook for another 3 minutes.\r\nAdd the tomato paste and stir it around for around 1 minute. Now add the cumin, paprika, mint, thyme, black pepper, and red pepper as quickly as you can and stir for 10 seconds to bloom the spices. Congratulate yourself on how amazing your house now smells.\r\nImmediately add the lentils, water, broth, and salt. Bring the soup to a (gentle) boil.\r\nAfter it has come to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, cover the pot halfway, and cook for 15-20 minutes or until the lentils have fallen apart and the carrots are completely cooked.\r\nAfter the soup has cooked and the lentils are tender, blend the soup either in a blender or simply use a hand blender to reach the consistency you desire. Taste for seasoning and add more salt if necessary.\r\nServe with crushed-up crackers, torn up bread, or something else to add some extra thickness.  You could also use a traditional thickener (like cornstarch or flour), but I prefer to add crackers for some texture and saltiness.  Makes great leftovers, stays good in the fridge for about a week.","strMealThumb":"https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/58oia61564916529.jpg","strTags":"Soup","strYoutube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVnZd8A84z4","strIngredient1":"Lentils","strIngredient2":"Onion","strIngredient3":"Carrots","strIngredient4":"Tomato Puree","strIngredient5":"Cumin","strIngredient6":"Paprika","strIngredient7":"Mint","strIngredient8":"Thyme","strIngredient9":"Black Pepper","strIngredient10":"Red Pepper Flakes","strIngredient11":"Vegetable Stock","strIngredient12":"Water","strIngredient13":"Sea Salt","strIngredient14":"","strIngredient15":"","strIngredient16":"","strIngredient17":"","strIngredient18":"","strIngredient19":"","strIngredient20":"","strMeasure1":"1 cup ","strMeasure2":"1 large","strMeasure3":"1 large","strMeasure4":"1 tbs","strMeasure5":"2 tsp","strMeasure6":"1 tsp ","strMeasure7":"1/2 tsp","strMeasure8":"1/2 tsp","strMeasure9":"1/4 tsp","strMeasure10":"1/4 tsp","strMeasure11":"4 cups ","strMeasure12":"1 cup ","strMeasure13":"Pinch","strMeasure14":" ","strMeasure15":" ","strMeasure16":" ","strMeasure17":" ","strMeasure18":" ","strMeasure19":" ","strMeasure20":" ","strSource":"https://findingtimeforcooking.com/main-dishes/red-lentil-soup-corba/","strImageSource":null,"strCreativeCommonsConfirmed":null,"dateModified":null},{"idMeal":"52978","strMeal":"Kumpir","strDrinkAlternate":null,"strCategory":"Side","strArea":"Turkish","strInstructions":"If you order kumpir in Turkey, the standard filling is first, lots of butter mashed into the potato, followed by cheese.

As an alternative for those wanting a different taste, or who need to avoid products containing gluten, some pastas can be made using rice flour in place of wheat.[3][4] Pastas may be divided into two broad categories, dried (pasta secca) and fresh (pasta fresca)."},{"idCategory":"7","strCategory":"Pork","strCategoryThumb":"https://www.themealdb.com/images/category/pork.png","strCategoryDescription":"Pork is the culinary name for meat from a domestic pig (Sus scrofa domesticus). It is the most commonly consumed meat worldwide,[1] with evidence of pig husbandry dating back to 5000 BC. Pork is eaten both freshly cooked and preserved. Curing extends the shelf life of the pork products. Ham, smoked pork, gammon, bacon and sausage are examples of preserved pork. Charcuterie is the branch of cooking devoted to prepared meat products, many from pork.\r\n\r\nPork is the most popular meat in Eastern and Southeastern Asia, and is also very common in the Western world, especially in Central Europe. It is highly prized in Asian cuisines for its fat content and pleasant texture. Consumption of pork is forbidden by Jewish and Muslim dietary law, a taboo that is deeply rooted in tradition, with several suggested possible causes. The sale of pork is limited in Israel and illegal in certain Muslim countries."},{"idCategory":"8","strCategory":"Seafood","strCategoryThumb":"https://www.themealdb.com/images/category/seafood.png","strCategoryDescription":"Seafood is any form of sea life regarded as food by humans.

Historically, sea mammals such as whales and dolphins have been consumed as food, though that happens to a lesser extent in modern times. Edible sea plants, such as some seaweeds and microalgae, are widely eaten as seafood around the world, especially in Asia (see the category of sea vegetables). In North America, although not generally in the United Kingdom, the term \"seafood\" is extended to fresh water organisms eaten by humans, so all edible aquatic life may be referred to as seafood.

In the United States and parts of Canada, an entrée is the main dish or the only dish of a meal.\r\n\r\nHistorically, the entrée was one of the stages of the “Classical Order” of formal French table service of the 18th and 19th centuries. It formed a part of the “first service” of the meal, which consisted of potage, hors d’œuvre, and entrée (including the bouilli and relevé). The “second service” consisted of roast (rôti), salad, and entremets (the entremets sometimes being separated into a “third service” of their own).

Distinctions are sometimes made between several categories of veganism. Dietary vegans (or strict vegetarians) refrain from consuming animal products, not only meat but also eggs, dairy products and other animal-derived substances.[c] The term ethical vegan is often applied to those who not only follow a vegan diet but extend the philosophy into other areas of their lives, and oppose the use of animals for any purpose.[d] Another term is environmental veganism, which refers to the avoidance of animal products on the premise that the harvesting or industrial farming of animals is environmentally damaging and unsustainable."},{"idCategory":"12","strCategory":"Vegetarian","strCategoryThumb":"https://www.themealdb.com/images/category/vegetarian.png","strCategoryDescription":"Vegetarianism is the practice of abstaining from the consumption of meat (red meat, poultry, seafood, and the flesh of any other animal), and may also include abstention from by-products of animal slaughter.\r\n\r\nVegetarianism may be adopted for various reasons. Many people object to eating meat out of respect for sentient life. Such ethical motivations have been codified under various religious beliefs, as well as animal rights advocacy. Other motivations for vegetarianism are health-related, political, environmental, cultural, aesthetic, economic, or personal preference. There are variations of the diet as well: an ovo-lacto vegetarian diet includes both eggs and dairy products, an ovo-vegetarian diet includes eggs but not dairy products, and a lacto-vegetarian diet includes dairy products but not eggs. A vegan diet excludes all animal products, including eggs and dairy.
